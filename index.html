        <h1>Hi there, I'm Joseph Stefanoni!</h1>
        <p>I am a student at Stevens Institute of Technology. I am majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Software Engineering. My career interests are in robotics, software development, and working with AI. I love coding and making websites, apps, or even hands on projects because it allows me to express my creativity and create fun, interesting, and interactive projects that will hopefully one day change the world for the better. :D</p>
